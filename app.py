    * **Create a `pages` directory** in the same folder as this `app.py` file.
    * **Place your page files** (e.g., `1_Home.py`, `2_Prediction.py`) inside the `pages` directory.
    * Streamlit will automatically detect these files and create navigation links in the sidebar.
    * The number prefix (e.g., `1_`, `2_`) determines the order of pages in the sidebar.

# # Assuming your model expects numerical inputs, create input fields
# # Replace these with the actual features your model expects
# feature1 = st.slider('Input Feature 1', min_value=0.0, max_value=10.0, value=5.0, step=0.1)
# feature2 = st.number_input('Input Feature 2', min_value=0.0, max_value=100.0, value=50.0)
# feature3 = st.checkbox('Input Feature 3 (True/False)')

# # Create a button to trigger prediction
# if st.button('Predict'):
#     # Prepare input data for the model
#     # This part heavily depends on how your model expects input.
#     # For example, if it's a scikit-learn model, it might expect a 2D array.
    
#     # Example: If your model expects a list of features
#     input_data = [feature1, feature2, 1 if feature3 else 0] # Convert boolean to 0 or 1

#     try:
#         # Make a prediction
#         # You might need to reshape your input_data depending on your model
#         # For a single prediction with a scikit-learn model, it's often model.predict([[feature1, feature2, ...]])
#         prediction = model.predict([input_data])
